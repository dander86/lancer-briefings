Tachyon lances project tachyon particles – essentially subatomic localized objects – faster than light toward their targets. These particles are impossible to perceive optically, and because they travel faster than light, can’t be seen or evaded. Although the particles are tiny, they travel with colossal speed and energy. The damage a tachyon lance deals to its target – should it hit – is unparalleled.","customDamageType":null,"maxUseOverride":0,"uses":0,"selectedProfile":0}}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":["cb_overpower_caliber"],"modifiable":true}],"integratedMounts":[{"weapon":{"id":"mw_fuel_rod_gun","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Gained from the \"Nuclear Cavalier\" Rank 3 Talent","customDamageType":null,"maxUseOverride":0,"uses":6,"selectedProfile":0}}],"improved_armament":{"mount_type":"Flex","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Flex","weapon":null}],"extra":[{"size":"Auxiliary","weapon":null}],"bonus_effects":[],"modifiable":true},"superheavy_mounting":{"mount_type":"Superheavy","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Superheavy","weapon":null}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":[],"modifiable":true},"integratedWeapon":{"mount_type":"Aux","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Auxiliary","weapon":null}],"extra":[],"bonus_effects":[],"modifiable":true},"extraMounts":[],"extraIntegratedMounts":[]}],"active_loadout_index":0}],"cc_ver":"","special_equipment":{"PilotGear":[],"Frames":[],"MechWeapons":[],"WeaponMods":[],"MechSystems":[],"SystemMods":[]},"combat_history":{"moves":0,"kills":0,"damage":0,"hp_damage":0,"structure_damage":0,"overshield":0,"heat_damage":0,"reactor_damage":0,"overcharge_uses":0,"core_uses":0},"state":{"active_mech_id":"b9aa49b2-a110-4e36-8f8e-58e0ed515891","remote_mech_id":"","stage":"Combat","turn":1,"mission":0,"actions":2,"braced":false,"overcharged":false,"prepare":false,"bracedCooldown":false,"redundant":false,"mounted":true,"stats":{"moves":0,"kills":0,"damage":0,"hp_damage":0,"structure_damage":0,"overshield":0,"heat_damage":0,"reactor_damage":0,"overcharge_uses":0,"core_uses":0},"deployed":[]},"lastModified":"Fri Jan 30 2026 01:52:46 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","lastUpdate_cloud":"Wed Nov 19 2025 16:21:57 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)","lastSync":"Wed Nov 19 2025 16:21:57 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)","skills":[{"id":"sk_act_unseen_or_unheard","rank":2},{"id":"sk_assault","rank":2},{"id":"sk_blow_something_up","rank":2},{"id":"sk_survive","rank":2},{"id":"sk_take_someone_out","rank":2}],"talents":[{"id":"t_crack_shot","rank":3},{"id":"t_nuclear_cavalier","rank":3},{"id":"t_brutal","rank":2},{"id":"t_house_guard","rank":1}],"mechSkills":[2,0,0,6],"counter_data":[],"custom_counters":[],"core_bonuses":["cb_overpower_caliber","cb_heatfall_coolant_system"],"licenses":[{"id":"mf_sherman","rank":3},{"id":"mf_deaths_head","rank":2}],"reserves":[],"orgs":[],"bondId":"","xp":0,"stress":0,"isBroken":false,"burdens":[],"bondPowers":[],"powerSelections":0,"maxStress":8,"bondAnswers":["",""],"minorIdeal":"","clocks":[],"group":"Used","sort_index":-1,"portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://d1nurxym97qk9o.cloudfront.net/public/us-east-1:88c19765-1cfb-c20d-f354-75c87ed42745/pilot/kalymos-in-her-favorite-hat-by-me-v0-j0teis5pgd8g1.webp","loadout":{"id":"781928c4-f5e7-4661-ba9a-99f079e237d2","name":"Primary","armor":[{"id":"pg_mobility_hardsuit","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"","customDamageType":null}],"weapons":[{"id":"pg_medium_signature","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Medium signature weapons are assault rifles, shotguns, pack-fed lasers, or disruption guns.","customDamageType":null},{"id":"pg_light_a_c","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Light A/C weapons might be knives, bayonets, punching daggers, and short swords.","customDamageType":null}],"gear":[{"id":"pg_omnihook","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"A portable – if bulky – omninet terminal that allows for communication, data transfer, and limited hot-spotting.
