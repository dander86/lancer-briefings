## The Drop

*“Life is full of surprises, some good, some not so good...”*  


# Goals

- Land at Forward Operating Base Sabre

# Stakes

- Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's timetable back and potentially narrowing the window of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.
